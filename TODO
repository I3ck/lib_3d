    PointCloud (has many points)
    Path (same as Point Cloud but with defined order)

    Mesh (similar to path, but each point being connected to more than one)

    still use Points? Differ between Vectors and Points? Or just make both the same?

    or make both derive from PointVector or similar

    make PointVec virtual and never use it?

    rename PointVec to BasePointVec or BasePointVector

    class Facet containing of 3 points and a normal?

    use worker threads when working on a lot of data

    make pointcloud data a kde tree?

    currently using * as scalar product for point, but not for quaternion

    test for quaternion missing, also usage for rotation not implemented yet (main reason for adding them)


    proper method chaining by returning references instead of void

    add a "saveable" interface which has a save / load method with binary or not and is pure virtual?

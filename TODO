Classes

    Point (x, y, z)
    Vector (x, y, z)

    Matrix (4 x 4)

    PointCloud (has many points)
    Path (same as Point Cloud but with defined order)

    MatrixFactory (Creates Matrixes for transformation, rotation etc.) [can also be done withoout a class, or Matrix constructors or similar]

    Mesh (similar to path, but each point being connected to more than one)

    Quanterions

    still use Points? Differ between Vectors and Points? Or just make both the same?

    or make both derive from PointVector or similar

    make PointVec virtual and never use it?

    rename PointVec to BasePointVec or BasePointVector
